A few things to note:

Before building, get headers for vmutils and Symbolication using
class-dump[1]:

 $ class-dump -H -o vmutils /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/vmutils.framework/vmutils 
 $ class-dump -H -o Symbolication /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Symbolication.framework/Symbolication 

Then within headers, remove all includes of NSObject.h. When trying to
build, it will fail not being able to find include paths. Either add
current dir to header search path, or change <>'s to ""'s.
